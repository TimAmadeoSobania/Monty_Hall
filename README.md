# Monty Hall
This is a fast and easy implementation of the [Monty Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) problem:

>*"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?"*

It shows, that after switching the door the possibility of winning the car is 66%.

While most people think that after the host opens one door the chance is 50/50, the crucial part happens actually when choosing the first door. As you make that decision the propability of choosing the right door is 1/3 = 33%. Logically the propability of the car beeing behind one of the other doows is 2/3 = 66%. This propability stays even after the host reveals one goat. The 66% are now on the other door.
